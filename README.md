# Comparative Study of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for Heart Disease Prediction

## Introduction
This project demonstrated the application of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to heart disease prediction using clinical features. The dataset was explored through visualization and further refined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and remove feature correlations. Both models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a clear comparison of their predictive capabilities. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of each method: Naive Bayes provided a simple yet effective baseline, while Logistic Regression achieved more robust and reliable performance after feature scaling.
